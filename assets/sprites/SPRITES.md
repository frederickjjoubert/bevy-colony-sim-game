# Sprites

## Folder Structure

There is one folder per artist.

The `game` folder is for original art.

## JSON Data

To make using sprites more ergonomic in the engine, we create a key-value pair mapping of a sprites `name` to a
sprites `path` in the `sprites.json` file.

We do the same for sprite sheets, with additional metadata of sprite size and offset, using the `sprite_sheets.json`
file.
